# COMP 3015
**COMP3015-Coursework2**

This project was created using Visual Studio Version 16.9.4.

This product is unique as it shows multiple shader implementation, customisable features & Object/texture changing. I got this idea when creating objects in blender, as I thought it would be beneficial to see how the model would look without having to take a long time to set it up in another program. The classesâ€™ function but being spilt up, where they can be called when required, being as efficient as possible. Code duplication has also tried to be kept to a minimum. This project started with a template in which I build upon over the time!

I believe I have achieved my goal, where this program uses multiple shaders, where there are mixing of complex shaders, using Fragment, vertex, and geometry methods. If I were to complete this task again, I feel like there are some buffers in which I could adapt to minimise potential duplication of code.

**How To Use**
* Use Menu to navigate through multiple shaders.
* Each menu has a drop down in which you can select to use.
* Select backgrounds if you want, some will not work on shaders as they are not designed to.
* Smoke/Fire may not load correctly on incompatible shaders, just turn off and back on again and should be fine!
* Most shaders will come with a GUI! you can change settings for the specific shader through this!
* Light, Rotation/Position/Scale can also be enabled for most shaders, with live updates!
* Open a File, some examples are named!

**How To Use .EXE**
* Simply double click "Project_Template.exe" and the program will run!
* place any textures/objects you want in the media folder!
* Now inspect your model in different shaders!

**How To Use Visual Studio**
* Double lick "Project_Template.sln"
* This will open Visual Studio
* Click debug and inspect your object!

**Please note:**
* To Use Custom Object Particle Effect, Go into Wireframe then Select Custom OBJ Particle system.
* There are dividers in the Shaders Dropdown menu, this indicates when different models need to be reloaded, so a second delay can occur.
* Loading Night Vision required regeneration of Noise texture, which can also take a second or two to load.
* Loading incorrect file names will cause a crash, this is due to the Try Catches built into the program already.
